Senior officials at Ethiopia’s Ministry of Mines and Petroleum say the government is set to
rescind an agreement with a US-based self-described energy firm after an investigation by
Quartz Africa revealed the company had no petroleum industry expertise or technical
credentials.

After the story was published, one local social media user drove to the company’s listed
address in Virginia, and found empty office space, with no sign of an extraction company in
the area.

When probed about the agreement earlier this year, Ethiopia’s minister of Mines Takele Uma
told Quartz Africa he was unaware of GreenComm’s existence, saying he had “no clue.” His
predecessor, Samuel Urkato, who has since gone on to become Ethiopia’s minister of
Science and Higher Education, acknowledged the existence of the deal when reached by
phone, but refused to speak any further, hanging up and ending the call. Zecharias Zelalem
